# Plot-Twist-Game
Plot Twist is a web-based multiplayer storytelling game where players collaboratively build stories over rotating rounds. Each participant adds to a mystery narrative, seeing only the previous segment. After several rounds, full stories are revealed and voted on by category, with points awarded to contributors and a final leaderboard.
